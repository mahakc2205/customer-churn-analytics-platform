# today is the current date and time.
# timedelta(days=1) means "a time difference of 1 day."
# Subtracting timedelta(days=1) from today gives you yesterdayâ€™s date.
# In simple words:
# timedelta is like saying "how much time to add or subtract."
# If you do today - timedelta(days=1), you get the date one day before today (yesterday).
# If you do today + timedelta(days=7), you get the date seven days after today.
